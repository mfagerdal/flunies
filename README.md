# flunies
One collaboratively developed and shared app that will help with flu, corona and other major outbreaks.

With the recent Corona outbreak, I have been thinking on how to help out. 

Please mail mfagerdal@gmail.com for collaborative work. Include short details on who you are and what you can contrbute with. 

Thanks! 

Description: 
A multidevice app that will:
- flews
  - news related to the outbreak
  - governmental, scientifical and factchecked information 
  - can be localized
  - can be alarmbased : "If this threshold happen of these numbers, alert with xyz"
  - can be easy resent by social media
  
- flubuddies
  - Who is your flubuddie - sign up and either tag people your flubuddy to or ask for a flubuddy
  - Later: post request for help like shopping, child care etc
  - Later: automatic ping - check up on your flubuddie automatically. If no response, start to worry ( a bit)
  - Later maybe: gamificed for youngones - how many points can you get for doing chores -> leaderboard entry
  
- flevents
  - When isolated, what can you do in your negighbourhood
    - events in your neighbourhood. Outdoor, turnbased/rtp gaming sessions etc
    
- florce
  - mark your self as available for helping out
    - have you got the corona and yhou are now ok ? Available to help the governments/hospitals on mundane tasks to take away load?
    - do you consider yourself healty, and can take a risk, and dont know if you got the virus? Available for helping governments / companies in proximity with some importnat tasks ? 
  - are you a governemtn that needs extra help to get the nurses and doctors for isntance to focus on their tasks ? Ask for hewlp her
  - are you a business where workforce is mostly gone due to infection and need help to keep the wheels turning, perhaps important to the government as well, with simple tasks ? 
  - Ask for help her
  
  
  Plan: 
  Setup team
  Start developing
  Provide a quick prototype and test the viability
  Then have different goals for different parts
  Flubuddies : put on appstore, play etc
  Flevents: get artists to join to make free events , market the feature
  Florce: market the function, approach governments and find way to make it data secure per country/legislation.
  
  TODO: Whoami, extensive WHy, security, "nonforprofit but if big will need to cover cost - business case"
