# flunies
One collaboratively shared app that will help with flu, corona and other major outbreaks.

With the recent Corona outbreak, I have been thinking on how to help out. 

Please mail mfagerdal@gmail.com for collaborative work.  

Description: 
A multidevice app that will 
- flubuddies
  - Who is your flubuddie - sign up and either tag people your flubuddy to or ask for a flubuddy
  - Later: post request for help like shopping, child care etc
  - Later: automatic ping - check up on your flubuddie automatically. If no response, start to worry ( a bit)
  
- flevents
  - When isolated, what can you do in your negighbourhood
    - events in your neighbourhood. Outdoor, turnbased/rtp gaming sessions etc
    
- florce
  - mark your self as available for helping out
    - have you got the corona and yhou are now ok ? Available to help the governments/hospitalks on mundane tasks to take away load?
    - do you consider yourself healty, and can take a risk, and dont know if you got the virus? Available for helping governments / companies in proximity with some importnat tasks ? 
  - are you a governemtn that needs extra help to get the nurses and doctors for isntance to focus on their tasks ? Ask for hewlp her
  - are you a business where workforce is mostly gone due to infection and need help to keep the wheels turning, perhaps important to the government as well, with simple tasks ? 
  - Ask for help her
  
  
  Plan: 
  Setup team
  Start developing
  Provide a quick prototype and test the viability
  Then have different goals for different parts
  Flubuddies : put on appstore, play etc
  Flevents: get artists to join to make free events , market the feature
  Florce: market the function, approach governments and find way to make it data secure per country/legislation.
